-- Thought Process:
-- Main idea is to use EXTRACT fx to find out day of the week after that logic is simple.


-- CODE

SELECT product_id, day_indicator, dates
FROM	(SELECT *, 
			EXTRACT('isodow' FROM dates) AS day,
			CASE 
				WHEN SUBSTRING(day_indicator, EXTRACT('isodow' FROM dates)::INT, 1) = '1'
				THEN 'IN'
				ELSE 'OUT'
			END AS status
		FROM Day_Indicator) AS x
WHERE status = 'IN';
