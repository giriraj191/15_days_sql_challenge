# 15 Days SQL Challenge | COMPLETED

## Overview  
Welcome to the 15 Days SQL Challenge! This challenge is based on [TechTFQ's](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thoufiq-mohammed/) 30 Days SQL Challenge and involves solving 2 interview-level SQL questions daily. Each day's challenge will include a problem statement, dataset, and solution, all organized within day-wise folders.

## Tools Used
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin 4  

*Above tools are entirely optional, as you may choose to execute it in any online code editor and SQL database of your choice.*

## Folder Structure

Each day's folder contains two subfolders, one for each question of the day. Each subfolder includes:  
1. Problem Statement: A description of the SQL problem to be solved.
2. Dataset: The necessary data files to load into PostgreSQL for solving the problem.
3. Solution: The SQL script that solves the problem.

This is how n<sup>th</sup> day's structure looks like.
```
│── day_n  
│   ├── question1  
│   │   ├── problem_statement  
│   │   ├── dataset
│   │   └── solution 
│   │
│   ├── question2  
│   │   ├── problem_statement 
│   │   ├── dataset
│   │   └── solution
```
