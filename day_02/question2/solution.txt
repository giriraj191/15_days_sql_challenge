-- SOLUTION 1

-- Thought Process:
-- As discussed in question1 of day 2 also, if we able to extract requried value from 
-- each column and if it is single cell then we can combine our results using 
-- CROSS JOIN.


-- CODE

-- OUTPUT 1
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT id FROM Q4_data ORDER BY id LIMIT 1)
CROSS JOIN (SELECT name FROM Q4_data WHERE name IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id LIMIT 1)
CROSS JOIN (SELECT location FROM Q4_data WHERE location IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id LIMIT 1);

-- OUTPUT 2
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT id FROM Q4_data ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1)
CROSS JOIN (SELECT name FROM Q4_data WHERE name IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id LIMIT 1)
CROSS JOIN (SELECT location FROM Q4_data WHERE location IS NOT NULL ORDER BY id LIMIT 1);


-- SOLUTION 2

-- CODE

-- OUTPUT 1
SELECT 
	MIN(id) AS id, 
	MIN(name) AS name, 
	MIN(location) AS location
FROM Q4_data;

-- OUTPUT 2
SELECT 
	MAX(id) AS id, 
	MAX(name) AS name, 
	MIN(location) AS location
FROM Q4_data;
