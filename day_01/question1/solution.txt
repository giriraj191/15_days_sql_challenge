-- Thought Process:
-- To make a pair, we need to combine both brands table with year to uniquely
-- identify the rows. Now, using that we can now include all the rows and filter
-- out only those rows which don't fit 'Condition 1' or which fit 'Condition 2'
-- from problem statement.


-- CODE

WITH cte AS (
	SELECT *,
	CASE
		WHEN brand1 < brand2 THEN CONCAT(brand1, brand2, year)
		ELSE CONCAT(brand2, brand1, year)
	END AS id
	FROM brands
), cte_row_number AS (
	SELECT *,
	ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY id ORDER BY id) AS row_no
	FROM cte
)
SELECT brand1, brand2, year, custom1, custom2, custom3, custom4 
FROM cte_row_number 
WHERE (row_no = 1 OR
	   custom1 <> custom3 AND custom2 <> custom4)
