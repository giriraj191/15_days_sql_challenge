-- SOLUTION

-- Thought Process:
-- It is a simple question if you know about the functions like
-- STRING_TO_ARRAY()
-- UNNEST()
-- LENGTH()
-- Just use them and finally aggregate the result output in one cell.


-- CODE

WITH cte_length AS (
	SELECT 
		id,
		LENGTH(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(items, ',')))::VARCHAR AS length
	FROM item
)
SELECT 	
    id, 
    STRING_AGG(length, ',')
FROM cte_length
GROUP BY id
ORDER BY id
