SELECT b.*

WHERE a.marks < b.marks




-- SOLUTION 2

-- Thought Process:
-- As we need previous row so, we can use LAG() window function fetch 
-- previous row value and then compare with current value.

-- OUTPUT 1

-- CODE 

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT *, LAG(marks, 1, 0) OVER (ORDER BY test_id) AS prev_test_mark
	  FROM student_tests) AS temp
WHERE temp.marks > prev_test_mark;


-- OUTPUT 2

-- CODE

SELECT *
FROM (SELECT *, LAG(marks, 1, marks) OVER (ORDER BY test_id) AS prev_test_mark
	  FROM student_tests) AS temp
WHERE temp.marks > prev_test_mark;
