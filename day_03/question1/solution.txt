-- Thought Process:
-- First, aggregate all the trns_type i.e., all income and deduction table data. After
-- that find a way to combine data with salary table.
-- HINT - As we need all type combination hence, we can use a type of join.


-- CODE

INSERT INTO emp_transaction
SELECT emp_id, emp_name, trns_type, ROUND(base_salary * (percentage/100), 2) amount
FROM salary
CROSS JOIN (SELECT income trns_type, CAST (percentage AS DECIMAL) percentage 
			FROM income
			UNION
			SELECT deduction trns_type, CAST (percentage AS DECIMAL) percentage 
			FROM deduction);

SELECT DISTINCT trns_type 
FROM emp_transaction;


-- OUTPUT 2

-- Thought Process:
-- As we need to convert row data into column we can use crosstab function to achieve this.


-- CODE

-- Creating tablefunc extension to use crosstab function
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS tablefunc;
