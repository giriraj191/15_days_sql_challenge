-- Solution

-- Thought Process:
-- It's a simple problem as we just have to sort according to age
-- and find the middle value, we can use ROW_NUMBER to make things
-- easy.


-- CODE

WITH cte AS (
	SELECT 
		country,
		age,
		ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY country) AS index,
		COUNT(*) OVER(PARTITION BY country
					  RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 
									UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)::DECIMAL 
                 AS total_people	
	FROM people
)	
SELECT country, age
FROM cte
WHERE index BETWEEN (total_people / 2) AND ((total_people / 2) + 1);
