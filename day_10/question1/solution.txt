-- SOLUTION 

-- Thought Process:
-- First, we have to find all the late delivery pizzas and then 
-- sum up the late pizzas and divide them with the total pizzas 
-- in order to find the percentage.


-- CODE

WITH cte AS (
	SELECT 
		TO_CHAR(order_time, 'Mon-YYYY') as period,
		no_of_pizzas,
		TO_CHAR(actual_delivery - order_time, 'MI')::INT AS time_taken,
		CASE
			WHEN 
				EXTRACT(HOUR FROM (actual_delivery - order_time)) * 60 +
                EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM (actual_delivery - order_time)) > 30
			THEN 1 
			ELSE 0
		END AS is_late
	FROM pizza_delivery
	WHERE actual_delivery IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
	period,
	ROUND((SUM(is_late)::DECIMAL / COUNT(1)) * 100, 1) AS delayed_percentage,
	SUM(CASE WHEN is_late = 1 THEN no_of_pizzas ELSE 0 END) AS free_pizzas
FROM cte
GROUP BY period
ORDER BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(period, 'Mon-YYYY'))
