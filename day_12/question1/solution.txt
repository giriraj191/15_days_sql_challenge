-- SOLUTION

-- Thought Process:
-- > Firstly, we need to sort out the data that all the passengers who-- 
--   arrive at the before the bus time must be present before that, or
--   atleast we have maintain the number.
-- > Then, we need to access the previous row/data everytime. Hence, we 
--   have to use RECURSIVE queries.


-- CODE

WITH RECURSIVE result AS (

	-- base query
	WITH passenger_count_info AS (
		SELECT
			ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY arrival_time) AS index,
			b.bus_id,
			b.capacity,
			(SELECT COUNT(*) 
			 FROM passengers AS p 
			 WHERE p.arrival_time <= b.arrival_time) as passenger_cnt
		FROM buses AS b	
	)
	SELECT  
		index,
		bus_id,
		capacity,
		passenger_cnt,
		LEAST(capacity, passenger_cnt) AS boarded,
		LEAST(capacity, passenger_cnt) AS total_boarded
	FROM passenger_count_info
	WHERE index = 1

	UNION

	-- recursive query
	SELECT  
		pci.index,
		pci.bus_id,
		pci.capacity,
		pci.passenger_cnt,
		LEAST(pci.capacity, pci.passenger_cnt - r.total_boarded) AS boarded,
		r.total_boarded + LEAST(pci.capacity, pci.passenger_cnt - r.total_boarded) AS total_boarded
	FROM result r
	JOIN passenger_count_info AS pci
	ON r.index + 1 = pci.index
	
)
SELECT 
	bus_id,
	boarded AS passenger_onboarded
FROM result
