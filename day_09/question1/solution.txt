-- SOLUTION 

-- Thought Process:
-- Just find a way to aggregate data on basis of consecutive dates, 
-- try adding or subtracting something. After you find a way to 
-- aggregate then you just have to subtract dates to find start and 
-- end dates.


-- CODE

	SELECT *,

									   ORDER BY user_id, login_date)::INT AS date_group
