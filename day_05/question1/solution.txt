-- SOLUTION

-- Thought Process:
-- If you see the final picture, you'll find out that we just
-- need to aggregate products at same date belonging to same 
-- customer. Hence, a best use case of GROUP BY clause, and for 
-- aggregation we can use inbuilt SQL function i.e., STRING_AGG().
-- Finally, just merge the aggregated products with the original
-- ones using UNION.


-- CODE

(
	SELECT 
		dates, 
		CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR) AS products
	FROM orders
	
) UNION (
	
	SELECT 
		dates,
		STRING_AGG(CAST(product_id AS VARCHAR), ',') AS products
	FROM orders	
	GROUP BY customer_id, dates
	
) ORDER BY dates;
