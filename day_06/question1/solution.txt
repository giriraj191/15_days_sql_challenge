-- SOLUTION

-- Thought Process:
-- Just use the difference of average and value and use WINDOW fx to eliminate the RANK 1


-- CODE

WITH result AS (
	WITH cte AS (
		SELECT *,
			ROUND(ABS(AVG(rating) 
					  OVER(PARTITION BY hotel 
						   RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) - rating), 
			      2) AS deviation
		FROM hotel_ratings
	)
	SELECT *,
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY hotel ORDER BY deviation DESC) AS pos
	FROM cte
)
SELECT hotel, year, rating
FROM result
WHERE pos > 1
ORDER BY hotel DESC, year;
