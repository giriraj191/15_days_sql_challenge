-- SOLUTION 

-- Thought Process:
-- Firstly, we have to aggregate data according to months. Then, 
-- for each current record we have to divide it with all the 
-- cases until now.
-- HINT: make another column for cummilative sum to save computation


-- CODE

WITH monthly_covid_cases AS (
	
	SELECT 
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM dates) AS month, 
		SUM(cases_reported) AS cases
	FROM covid_cases
	GROUP BY EXTRACT(MONTH FROM dates)
	ORDER BY month
	
), result AS (
	
	SELECT *,
		SUM(cases) OVER(ORDER BY month) AS cum_cases
	FROM monthly_covid_cases
	
) 
SELECT 
	month,
	cases,
	CASE 
		WHEN month > 1 
		THEN ROUND(
				cases / LAG(cum_cases) OVER(ORDER BY month) * 100, 
				2
			 )::VARCHAR
		ELSE '-'
	END AS percent_increase
FROM result
