		FROM friends
	) ORDER BY 1, 2
)
SELECT 
	f.*, 
	COUNT(af.friend2)
FROM friends f
LEFT JOIN allfriends af
ON (f.friend1 = af.friend1)
   AND af.friend2 IN (SELECT af2.friend2
					  FROM allfriends af2
					  WHERE f.friend2 = af2.friend1)
GROUP BY f.friend1, f.friend2
ORDER BY f.friend1, f.friend2
