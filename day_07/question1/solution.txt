-- SOLUTION

-- Thought Process:
-- The main idea is to aggregate number of managers and then 
-- grouping them together and finding the count.
-- You can either aggregate managers first and then attach each
-- of them with their respective names using JOIN clause or 
-- you can first join to attach each of them with their names and
-- then count the number of managers.


-- CODE 1

WITH cte as (
	SELECT 
		manager, 
		COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
	FROM employee_managers
	GROUP BY manager
	HAVING manager IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT 
	b.name AS managers, 
	a.number_of_employees
FROM cte a
JOIN employee_managers b
ON a.manager = b.id
ORDER BY a.number_of_employees DESC;


-- CODE 2

SELECT 
	b.name AS managers,
	COUNT(*) AS number_of_employees
FROM employee_managers a
JOIN employee_managers b
ON a.manager = b.id
GROUP BY b.name
ORDER BY number_of_employees DESC;
